# image-gallery-project

### Hello and thanks for stopping by this project repository! This is a project in which I built an image gallery from scratch using the Gatsby framework. All images are stored on Cloudinary, so you won't be finding them here.

### Features include a slideshow capable of navigating between full sized images, image scaling and dragging, and an optimized image grid that makes up the gallery.
